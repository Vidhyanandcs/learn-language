I was looking at the possibility of creating an application that can aid both children and adults to learn a new language of communication from their home during the time of pandemic. My requirements were very clear.

1)It should be a web application so that users with basic android phone can use it with out an app installation.
2)It should be light-weight so that users with slow internet connection can access it.
3)It should be designed with free tools available in the market.
4)Should be interactive.


## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Node.JS: 14.16.0
* MediaStream Recording API
* Web Speech API

The CSS has been written without any CSS frameworks. We have used felxbox and CSS grid. This makes the application easier to maintain and light weight.
